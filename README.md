# Ironhack-Module-1-Project---Pipelines---MMA

In this project I will work with data of THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.

I've generated the following files:
-module1.py
-module2.py
-module3.py
-module4.py
-main_script.py

In this project I have cleaned the dataset, I have enriched the database using two sources. The first one consist in current data of billionaires through an api that generate a json. The second one I obtain the data with web scraping. This two sources help us to obtain additional data and features about the billionaires.

- The api I've used is 'https://forbes400.herokuapp.com/api/forbes400/getAllBillionaires'

- The web I've used is 'https://stats.areppim.com/listes/list_billionairesx18xwor.htm'

In addition, the process generate a report in PDF. To generate a PDF I've used the library fpdf.
